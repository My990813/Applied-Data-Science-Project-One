- Wrote functions to web scrape missing info (director, writer, synopsis, etc.) from [mydramalist.com](https://mydramalist.com) using Selenium and BeautifulSoup (but it's very slow...)
- Classified sentiment of reviews using Hugging Face's `transformers` library and a custom distilbert model
- Combined: 
    - [Visualization.ipynb](Visualization.ipynb)
    - ["Project One DateNew.ipynb"](Project One DateNew.ipynb)
    - ["EDA and Feature Engineering(2)(1).ipynb"](EDA and Feature Engineering(2)(1).ipynb) + plotted log probabilites from class

[data](./data/) -- folder containing all data files

APSProjectOneReportFinalRevised.pdf--Uploaded by Mengyan Li--draft of the report

Visualization.ipynb---Updated and renamed as BarPlotAndBoxPlot.ipynb by Zishun

EDA and Feature Engineering.ipynb---Modified by Zishun---included additional one-hot encoded categorical columns:

1. Keep `year` and reverting it to `int` type

2. Drop `org_net` since it's too troublesome to handle

3. Drop all 10 original num_columns, keep StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler of `pop` and `n_helpful`

4. In addition multiple-hot encoded air_on
