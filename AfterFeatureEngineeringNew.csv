The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is “not handsome.” In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.  Sparks fly when they meet and struggle to overcome their biases for and against people with flaws.

Although she works harder than most producers, the shows she makes all seem to flop. Then she's selected to produce a new dating-themed reality TV show called “Kingdom of Love.” Her neighbour and best friend of twenty years is Park Jae Hoon, a plastic surgeon who has lost all his passion for work. Their relationship is close but purely platonic. Park Jae Hoon is jaded by his experiences and has also essentially given up on love. As such, he only ever pursues casual relationships. In the planning stage of the show’s production, Goo Yeo Reum runs into struggles, having difficulty finding suitable bachelors to appear on the programme. She eventually turns to Park Jae Hoon in desperation. To help her, he agrees to become a contestant on the show. But in this unfamiliar new dynamic—as a producer and a cast member—they unexpectedly begin developing never-felt-before romantic feelings. Will “Kingdom of Love” turn friends into lovers?

On the other hand, Mi Na is Hee Jae's confident and energetic best friend and colleague at Play Books, a supplier of books and related products centered around sex and romance. While an expert in how to achieve physical pleasure, her understanding falls short on romantic relationships. When they find themselves told to take over hosting a sex and romance advice podcast, the two feel more than a little lost.Having never experienced an orgasm or explored her own sexuality beyond routine, lifeless intercourse with her boyfriend of five years, Hee Jae isn’t the most qualified person to be hosting a sex advice podcast.

Heartbroken, she decides to try to make a new start by finding a job and interviews at a café named Finland Papa operated by a mysterious figure known only as “Papa.” When she arrives, the staff members give her a meal and eat with her. She proceeds to do so — only to discover that eating was actually her “interview!”Lee Yu Ri lands the job, but is soon flummoxed to learn that the other staff members, like her, have no idea who Papa is. She also comes to learn that the staff members must take on “family names” and must always dine together to maintain “family harmony.” This rule echoes sage words her grandmother once told her. It also reminds her of her closest friend and first love Baek Woo Hyun. When they were younger, Baek Woo Hyun would never let Lee Yu Ri eat alone and always did his best to raise her spirits. Their parting was sad.
